Workflow Explanation

    Input Number of Processes and Resources:
        The user is prompted to enter the number of processes (n) and the number of resources (m).

    Initialize Matrices and Arrays:
        alloc[n][m]: Allocation matrix where alloc[i][j] represents the number of resource j allocated to process i.
        max[n][m]: Maximum matrix where max[i][j] represents the maximum demand of resource j by process i.
        avail[m]: Available resources array where avail[j] represents the number of available instances of resource j.
        total[m]: Total instances of resources array where total[j] represents the total number of instances of resource j.

    Input Allocation Matrix:
        The user is prompted to enter the allocation matrix.

    Input Maximum Matrix:
        The user is prompted to enter the maximum matrix.

    Input Total Instances of Resources:
        The user is prompted to enter the total instances of resources.

    Calculate Available Resources:
        The available resources are calculated by subtracting the allocated resources from the total resources for each resource type.

    Initialize Necessary Arrays:
        f[n]: Finish array where f[i] indicates whether process i has finished (1) or not (0).
        ans[n]: Safe sequence array where ans stores the safe sequence of processes.
        need[n][m]: Need matrix where need[i][j] represents the remaining need of resource j for process i.

    Calculate Need Matrix:
        The need matrix is calculated by subtracting the allocation matrix from the maximum matrix for each process and resource type.

    Banker's Algorithm to Find Safe Sequence:
        The algorithm iterates through the processes to find a safe sequence.
        For each process, it checks if the process can be allocated the available resources (i.e., if the need of the process is less than or equal to the available resources).
        If a process can be allocated the resources, it is added to the safe sequence, and the resources allocated to the process are added back to the available resources.
        The process is marked as finished.

    Check if System is in a Safe State:
        The algorithm checks if all processes have finished. If not, the system is not in a safe state.

    Print Safe Sequence:
        If the system is in a safe state, the safe sequence is printed.

Sure, let's take an example and do a dry run of the complete code step by step.

    need[2][0] = max[2][0] - alloc[2][0] = 9 - 3 = 6
    need[2][1] = max[2][1] - alloc[2][1] = 0 - 0 = 0

        [1, 2, 2],
        [6, 0, 0]
    ]
    ```

        - Process 1: `need[1] = [1, 2, 2]` is less than or equal to `avail = [5, 4, 5]`.
            - Allocate resources to Process 1.
            - Update `avail`: `avail = [5 + 2, 4 + 0, 5 + 0] = [7, 4, 5]`
            - Mark Process 1 as finished: `f[1] = 1`
            - Add Process 1 to safe sequence: `ans[ind++] = 1`
    - **Second Iteration**:

    Following is the SAFE Sequence
     P1 -> P2 -> P0
    ```

### Summary
The Banker's Algorithm successfully finds a safe sequence for the given input. 
The safe sequence is `P1 -> P2 -> P0`, indicating that the system can allocate resources to 
these processes in this order without leading to a deadlock.

bankers algorithm code:
for (k = 0; k < n; k++) {
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (f[i] == 0) {
            int flag = 0;
            for (j = 0; j < m; j++) {
                if (need[i][j] > avail[j]) {
                    flag = 1;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (flag == 0) {
                ans[ind++] = i;
                for (int y = 0; y < m; y++) {
                    avail[y] += alloc[i][y];
                }
                f[i] = 1;
            }
        }
    }
}

Explanation of Variables and Loops

    Outer Loop (for (k = 0; k < n; k++)):
        This loop runs n times to ensure that all processes are checked multiple times if necessary.

    Inner Loop (for (i = 0; i < n; i++)):
        This loop iterates over each process to check if it can be allocated the available resources.

    Check if Process is Finished (if (f[i] == 0)):
        This condition checks if the process i has not finished yet (f[i] == 0).

    Flag Initialization (int flag = 0):
        A flag is initialized to 0. This flag will be used to determine if the process can be allocated the available resources.

    Resource Check Loop (for (j = 0; j < m; j++)):
        This loop iterates over each resource to check if the need of the process i for resource j is less than or equal to the available resources.

    Check Resource Availability (if (need[i][j] > avail[j])):
        If the need of process i for resource j is greater than the available resources, set the flag to 1 and break out of the loop.

    Allocate Resources if Possible (if (flag == 0)):
        If the flag is still 0 after checking all resources, it means the process can be allocated the available resources.
        Add the process i to the safe sequence (ans[ind++] = i).
        Update the available resources by adding the resources allocated to process i back to the available resources (avail[y] += alloc[i][y]).
        Mark the process i as finished (f[i] = 1).

example dry run of above snippet of code:
Initial Calculations:
avail = [5, 4, 5]
need = [
    [7, 4, 3],
    [1, 2, 2],
    [6, 0, 0]
]
f = [0, 0, 0]
ans = [0, 0, 0]
ind = 0

Dry Run:

    First Iteration (k = 0):
        Process 0 (i = 0):
            need[0] = [7, 4, 3] is not less than or equal to avail = [5, 4, 5] (fails for resource 0).
        Process 1 (i = 1):
            need[1] = [1, 2, 2] is less than or equal to avail = [5, 4, 5].
            Allocate resources to Process 1.
            Update avail: avail = [5 + 2, 4 + 0, 5 + 0] = [7, 4, 5]
            Mark Process 1 as finished: f[1] = 1
            Add Process 1 to safe sequence: ans[ind++] = 1 (ind becomes 1)
        Process 2 (i = 2):
            need[2] = [6, 0, 0] is less than or equal to avail = [7, 4, 5].
            Allocate resources to Process 2.
            Update avail: avail = [7 + 3, 4 + 0, 5 + 2] = [10, 4, 7]
            Mark Process 2 as finished: f[2] = 1
            Add Process 2 to safe sequence: ans[ind++] = 2 (ind becomes 2)

    Second Iteration (k = 1):
        Process 0 (i = 0):
            need[0] = [7, 4, 3] is less than or equal to avail = [10, 4, 7].
            Allocate resources to Process 0.
            Update avail: avail = [10 + 0, 4 + 1, 7 + 0] = [10, 5, 7]
            Mark Process 0 as finished: f[0] = 1
            Add Process 0 to safe sequence: ans[ind++] = 0 (ind becomes 3)

    Third Iteration (k = 2):
        All processes are already finished (f = [1, 1, 1]), so no further allocation is needed.

Final State:
f = [1, 1, 1]
ans = [1, 2, 0]
avail = [10, 5, 7]

output:
Following is the SAFE Sequence
 P1 -> P2 -> P0
